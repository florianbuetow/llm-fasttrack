# LLM-FastTrack

This is where I'm keeping track of everything I learn about Large Language Models.
It's straightforward â€“ notes, code, and links to useful resources.

## What's Inside

- **Notes:** Quick thoughts, summaries, and explanations I've written down to better understand LLM concepts.
- **Code:** The actual code I've written while experimenting with LLMs. It's not always pretty, but it works (mostly).
- **Resources:** Links to articles, papers, and tutorials that have cleared things up for me. No fluff, just the good stuff.

## Why This Repo

I needed somewhere to dump my brain as I dive into LLMs. Maybe it'll help someone else, maybe not. But it's helping me keep track of my progress and organize my thoughts.

Feel free to look around if you're into LLMs or just curious about what I'm learning. No promises, but you might find something useful.
