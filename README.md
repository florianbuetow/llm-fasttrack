# LLM-FastTrack

This is where I'm keeping track of everything I learn about Large Language Models.
It's straightforward â€“ notes, code, and links to useful resources.

## What's Inside

- **Notes:** Quick thoughts, summaries, and explanations I've written down to better understand LLM concepts.
- **Code:** The actual code I've written while experimenting with LLMs. It's not always pretty, but it works (mostly).
- **Resources:** Links to articles, papers, and tutorials that have cleared things up for me. No fluff, just the good
  stuff.

## Why This Repo

I needed somewhere to dump my brain as I dive into LLMs. Maybe it'll help someone else, maybe not. But it's helping me
keep track of my progress and organize my thoughts.

Feel free to look around if you're into LLMs or just curious about what I'm learning. No promises, but you might find
something useful.

# My Study Notes

Most of my notes will be in the form of notebooks, and I will link them in each section.
I will also write a short summary of the key points I've learned in each section.

### Before getting started

At the moment I prefer to use PyCharmPro as my dev environment. The benefits are venv- and notebook support and full IDE
support (with CoPilot).
If you want to run any of my code, you need to set up and activate a virtual environment and install the required
packages with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively follow these installation guides

* https://pytorch.org/get-started
* https://jupyter.org/install

## PyTorch

I am a software engineer and already know how to code. But I am new to the PyTorch library and want to get familiar and
fluent writing code with it before I dive deeper into LLMs.
If you don't know how to program, I would recommend to take at least a short introductory course into Python before
continuing.

### Tensors

* [001-pytorch-tensors.ipynb](https://github.com/florianbuetow/llm-fasttrack/blob/main/notebooks/001-pytorch-tensors.ipynb):
  Learning to work with tensors in PyTorch

### Summary

- PyTorch tensor is an n-dimensional array that is the same as a NumPy array or TensorFlow tensor.
- A rank 0 tensor as a scalar, a rank 1 tensor as a vector, and a rank 2 tensor as a matrix.
- Tensors of different dimension and with different sizes can be created from Python lists, NumPy arrays, or random
  values.
- The size and dimension of a tensor can be accessed using the `size()` and `dim()` methods.

```python
import torch

my_tensor = torch.randn((2, 3, 4), dtype=torch.float)
print("The dtype of my tensor a is:", my_tensor.dtype)
print("The size of my tensor a is:", my_tensor.size())
print("The shape of my tensor a is:", my_tensor.shape)
print("The dims of my tensor a is:", my_tensor.dim())
print("The dims of my tensor a is:", my_tensor.ndim)
print("The number of elements in my tensor is:", my_tensor.numel())
print("My tensor is stored on the GPU:", my_tensor.is_cuda)
print("My tensor is stored on device:", my_tensor.device)
```

PyTorch offers different data types, choosing the right one is important because it will influence the memory usage and
the performance.
Some PyTorch methods have requirements on the datatype of the tensor as well.

| Data Type              | dtype                      | CPU tensor         | GPU tensor              |
|------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|
| 32-bit floating point  | torch.float32/torch.float  | torch.FloatTensor  | torch.cuda.FloatTensor  |
| 64-bit floating point  | torch.float64/torch.double | torch.DoubleTensor | torch.cuda.DoubleTensor |
| 8-bit integer (signed) | torch.int16                | torch.ShortTensor  | torch.cuda.ShortTensor  |
| boolean                | torch.bool                 | torch.BoolTensor   | torch.cuda.BoolTensor   |

|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Temperature**              | affects the randomness of the model's output by scaling the logits before applying softmax, influencing the model's "creativity" or certainty in its predictions. Lower temperatures lead to more deterministic outputs, while higher temperatures increase diversity and creativity. | [Peter Chng](https://peterchng.com/blog/2023/05/02/token-selection-strategies-top-k-top-p-and-temperature/) 
| **Top P (Nucleus Sampling)** | selects a subset of likely outcomes by ensuring the cumulative probability exceeds a threshold p, allowing for adaptive and context-sensitive text generation. This method focuses on covering a certain amount of probability mass.                                                  | [Peter Chng](https://peterchng.com/blog/2023/05/02/token-selection-strategies-top-k-top-p-and-temperature/) |
| **Top K**                    | limits the selection pool to the K most probable next words, reducing randomness by excluding less likely predictions from consideration. This method normalizes the probabilities of the top K tokens to sample the next token.                                                      | [Peter Chng](https://peterchng.com/blog/2023/05/02/token-selection-strategies-top-k-top-p-and-temperature/) |
| **Q (Query)**                | represents the input tokens being compared against key-value pairs in attention mechanisms, facilitating the model's focus on different parts of the input sequence for predictions.                                                                                                  |
| **K (Key)**                  | represents the tokens used to compute the amount of attention that input tokens should pay to the corresponding values, crucial for determining focus areas in the model's attention mechanism.                                                                                       |
| **V (Value)**                | is the content that is being attended to, enriched through the attention mechanism with information from the key, indicating the actual information the model focuses on during processing.                                                                                           |
| **Embeddings**               | are high-dimensional representations of tokens that capture semantic meanings, allowing models to process words or tokens by encapsulating both syntactic and semantic information.                                                                                                   |
| **Tokenizers**               | are tools that segment text into manageable pieces for processing by models, with different algorithms affecting model performance and output quality.                                                                                                                                |
| **Rankers**                  | are algorithms used to order documents or predict their relevance to a query, influencing the selection of next words or sentences based on certain criteria in NLP applications.                                                                                                     |
